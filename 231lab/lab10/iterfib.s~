@ Develop Fibonacci calculator iteratively.
@ 1: The largest value k is 46, because 2 ^32 is slightly less than  
	@ the value of the 46th Fibonacci cycle.

@ 2: Yes, because the unsigned integer method can take in one more
	@ additional value than the signed integer method.

@ 3: The time it took for fib.s to run F(40) was 0.010 s; 
	@ for iterfib.s, it was 8.097 s.
