# Known Issues

## Client (simget) :
	*Sometimes it will either timeout or sit for awhile before finishing

## Server (simhttp) : 
	*Buffer limits do exist and will create seg faults if file paths or 
	 files are too big
	*404 Errors will print to standard output with DATE instead of an actual
	 date.

# Design

## Client (simget) :
	The client is based off of the given TCPEchoServer. The first task was
	to remove the http:// since gethostbyname didn't seem to like that.
	Afterwards I found the directory at the end of the url. Finally, I sent
	my request and outputted the response to either standard output or the
	file given.

## Server (simhttp) :
	The server is based off of the given TCPEchoClient, and almost all of
	the simhttp.c file is taken from it. My code is in the HandleTCPClient.c
	which is after all of the TCP part is dealt with. My plan was to focus
	on finding all of the cases where an error code response was needed.
	Once I solved the error codes on the test script with the correct
	standard output and response message, I worked on sending the correct
	response. This can be seen where all of my if else ifs start with error
	checking before having an else for the correct response. To create my
	response string, I either create the entire error message or for the 
	correct respone, I split each piece up (content type, size, etc.).
