Factorial.c program

1.  When you ran the program before using gdb (step 5 in the lab 
	 instructions), what output did you get with input of 3 and 
	 with input of 5 ??  
    With the input of 3, I got 0. With the input of 5, I got 0 as well.


2.  What output should you have gotten with each of those inputs?
    3 should result in 6, and 5 should result in 120.


3.  Why is the output incorrect?  Fix the program so that it works and
	 explain how you fixed it.
    The output is incorrect because as the variable "n" decreases, it 
    includes 0, and anything times 0 is zero. By continuing to decrease 
    the value of "n", but stopping the function before "n" equals zero,
    you get the correct factorial.

segFault.c program

4.  Why would buf still be NULL after the malloc function call?  Use the
	 man pages with malloc to see if you can get any ideas.

    Because the malloc function has a number in the tenth power position that
    makes buf a negative number.

5.  How can you fix the program so that it doesn't segfault?
     The program prints the messages when 1<<31 is changed to 1<<30.
