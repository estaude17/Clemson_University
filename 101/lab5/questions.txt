CP SC 101: Lab 5, Fall 2014

Using an editor, answer the following questions:

NAME: Elizabeth Stauder


1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c?
   Line 10 must say:
   for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
   because if i=0, it can't also be greater than or equal to 5.
2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on?
   28
2) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault?
   10
3) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault?
   568
4) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault?
   1
5) What are the values in the "table" array?
   {5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26}
6) what do you think the bug is?
   In broken.c, the bugs are that:
   Line 27 must say:
      while (search == 1) {
   Line 28 must say:
      if ((table[i++] == 11) || (count <= i)) {
